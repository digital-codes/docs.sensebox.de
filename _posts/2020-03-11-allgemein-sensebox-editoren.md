You can program the senseBox MCU using three different editors. 

## Blockly for senseBox

With Blockly for senseBox you can program your senseBox MCU via a graphical programming interface. No software needs to be installed on the computer and you can start right away. There is an app for tablets so that the senseBox can also be programmed wirelessly.

## Arduino IDE

You can download the Arduino IDE free of charge from the [Arduino website](https://arduino.cc/downloads). The Arduino IDE gives you complete access to all the functions provided by the Arduino programming language. Using the Arduino IDE you can also program additional sensors and components that are not included in Blockly for senseBox or openRoberta. The Arduino IDE must be installed on the computer. Additionally, a Board Support Package for the senseBox MCU must be downloaded. How exactly this works, you can find out [here](/general/board support-package-install/).

## openRoberta

openRoberta is another way to program the senseBox. The openRoberta lab requires no installation on your computer and offers a similar functionality as Blockly for senseBox. A short introduction to the use of the senseBox in openRoberta can be found [here](/general/general-introduction-openroberta/).
