Precise CO2 sensor from Swiss manufacturer Sensirion. The sensor board has a JST PHR4 connector, suitable for operation with the senseBox MCU. Furthermore it is equipped with the Quikk Connect System.

In addition to CO2 detection, a first-class Sensirion humidity and temperature sensor is used on the same sensor module. Thanks to the applied dual-channel principle for measuring the carbon dioxide concentration, the sensor is designed to automatically compensate for long-term drifts.

This sensor should only be used to measure indoors.
