## General
Various environmental sensors are located in the senseBox. In this chapter, we will first restrict ourselves to the sensors already installed on the senseBox MCU or those that can be connected via JST cable. 

> To read out and display measured values, it is best to use the display. In this chapter we use a kind of minimal example to show measured values on the display.

## Accelerometer (BMX055)
The acceleration sensor is already installed on the senseBox MCU. It can give you the acceleration in X-, Y-, and Z-axis and the total acceleration. You can choose the measuring range between 2g, 4g, 8g and 16g.

{% include image.html image=page.image0 %}

> The mean acceleration due to gravity is given in *g* and is rounded off to 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup>

## Button
A button is already installed on the senseBox MCU. Additional buttons can be connected via the three digital ports. In the dropdown menu different modes for the button can be selected:

- __is pressed__: With this mode you can ask if the block is pressed at the moment. You will get either the value TRUE or FALSE.
- __was pressed__: With this mode you can ask if the block was pressed. Only if the button was pressed and released you will get TRUE back
- __as switch__: If you use this mode you can use the button like a light switch. The status is saved until the button is pressed again

## Temperature and humidity sensor (HDC1080)
The temperature and humidity sensor is plugged into one of the five I2C/Wire ports. It can give you the temperature in 째C and the relative humidity in %.

{% include image.html image=page.image1 %}

## Temperature and Air Pressure Sensor (BMP280)
The temperature and air pressure sensor is plugged into one of the five I2C/Wire ports. It can give you the temperature in 째C, the air pressure in Pa and the altitude above sea level in m.

{% include image.html image=page.image2 %}

## Brightness and UV sensor (TSL45315 & VEML6070)
The brightness and UV sensor is connected to one of the five I2C/Wire ports. It can tell you the brightness in lux and the UV intensity in &mu;W/cm<sup>2</sup>.

{% include image.html image=page.image3 %}

## Environmental sensor (BME680)
The environmental sensor is connected to one of the five I2C-Wire ports. It can give you the temperature in 째C, relative humidity in %, air pressure in Pa and indoor air quality (IAQ) on a scale of 0-500.

In addition to the parameters mentioned above, the sensor can also give you the calibration value (a status message) and partial quantities CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent and breathing air VOC of the indoor air quality.

## Fine particular sensor (SDS011)
The fine particular sensor is connected to one of the two UART/Serial ports and the respective port is selected in the block. It can give you the fine dust concentration PM2.5 and PM10 in &mu;g/cm<sup>3</sup>.
