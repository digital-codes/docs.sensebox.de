It is possible to upload sensor data to the openSenseMap via [LoRaWANâ„¢](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Range_Wide_Area_Network) through [TheThingsNetwork](https://thethingsnetwork.org)(TTN).

LoRa is an increasingly widespread radio standard which, similar to WiFi, allows digital data transmission in an IP network, but offers significantly different features. The TheThingsNetwork offers in Germany a very good coverage with ~2000 gateways in international comparison.
