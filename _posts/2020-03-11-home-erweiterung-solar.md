## Powerboost

The [Adafruit Powerboost 1000C](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2465) uses an integrated charging circuit to ensure that the solar cell charges the battery and the battery in turn operates the senseBox.

## Connection
To use the senseBox with a solar panel, all you need is a power boost and a [LiPo battery](https://eckstein-shop.de/LiPo-Akku-Lithium-Ion-Polymer-Batterie-37V-2000mAh-JST-PH-Connector), something around 1000 mAh should be enough. How the components are connected, you can see in the picture below. We recommend a [fire protection bag](https://www.amazon.de/Jamara-141360-LiPo-Guard-Lipobrandschutztasche/dp/B003OFCUIS/ref=sr_1_18?keywords=LIPO+TRESOR&qid=1556284975&s=gateway&sr=8-18) for the battery, because there is a high risk of injury if the battery is damaged.

><b>Important<b><br>The LiPo battery and the Powerboost should be set up protected from moisture when you operate the station outside. The matching case is included in the set, but is also the same as for the fine dust sensor, for example. Note that low temperatures can severely affect the performance of the battery.
