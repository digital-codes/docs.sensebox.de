The Ethernet-Bee is used for connecting the senseBox to the Internet via cable. The LAN-Bee is based on the W5500 microchip from Wiznet, which enables a high data transfer rate.

## Technical Information

* "Plug-in-and-Go" senseBox compatible
* 3.3V operating voltage with 5V I/O signal Tolerance
* Dimensions: 46mm x 25mm x 12mm
* Weight: 9.2 g


## Programming

```arduino
#include <SPI.h>
#include <Ethernet.h>
#include <senseBoxIO.h>

void setup()
{
    // Initializes the serial monitor
    Serial.begin(9600);
    // Restarts W5500 (LAN-Bee) in XBEE1 socket
    senseBoxIO.powerXB1(false);
    delay(250);
    senseBoxIO.powerXB1(true);
    Ethernet.init(PIN_XB1_CS);
}

void loop()
{
    // Outputs IP address of the senseBox
    ip = Ethernet.localIP();
    Serial.print("IP: ");
    Serial.println(ip);
    delay(5000);
}
```

## Hints and tips

The LAN-Bee is supplied without LAN cable. For a permanent outdoor installation, flat LAN cables are particularly suitable, which can easily be laid outside through windows and doors. Especially in combination with Power over Ethernet (PoE), the senseBox can then be easily operated.
