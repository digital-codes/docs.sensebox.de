The Wifi-Bee is the connecting piece to connect the senseBox to the Internet. The data from the senseBox is transferred to the existing network via WLAN (WiFi). The WiFi-Bee is based on the ATWINC1500 microchip from Atmel.

## Technical Information

* "Plug-in-and-Go" senseBox compatible
* Single-band 2.4GHz b/g/n
* Operating voltage: 3.0V to 4.2V
* Encryption protocols: WPA/WPA2 Personal, TLS, SSL
* Network services: DHCP, DNS, TCP/IP (IPv4), UDP, HTTP, HTTPS
* Designation: WINC1500
* Dimensions: 24mm x 25mm x 9mm
* Weight: 3.5 g

## Connection test

To test the Bees' connection to the Internet, i.e. to check the function of both the component and the network, use the following sketch:

```arduino
#include <SPI.h>
#include <WiFi101.h>
#include <senseBoxIO.h>

void setup()
{
    // Initializes the serial monitor
    Serial.begin(9600);

    // Launch WINC1500 (WiFi-Bee) in XBEE1 socket new
    senseBoxIO.powerXB1(false);
    delay(250);
    senseBoxIO.powerXB1(true);
}

void loop()
{
    delay(5000);
    // Displays installed and latest firmware version
    String fv = WiFi.firmwareVersion();
    Serial.print("Firmware installed: ");
    Serial.println(fv);
    Serial.print("Latest firmware: ");
    Serial.println(WIFI_FIRMWARE_LATEST_MODEL_B);

    // Outputs IP address of the senseBox
    IPAddress ip = WiFi.localIP();
    Serial.print("IP: ");
    Serial.println(ip);
    delay(5000);
}
```

If values are displayed in the serial monitor for all outputs, especially the IP address is displayed in the form _192.107.256.4_, the WiFi-Bee is correctly initialized and the senseBox can be used with the Internet.

## Update the firmware of the WiFi-Bees

> Sorry, some of our WiFi Bees of type WINC1500 have an outdated firmware (version 19.4.4) installed. Unfortunately there is no other way to update this firmware than to do it manually. The following chapter explains how to find out which firmware you are using and (if you have an outdated version) how to update it.

### Test the version

First you need to check which version your WiFi-Bee has. Go to 'File' -> 'Examples' in the Arduino IDE and under 'Examples for senseBox MCU' to 'Test_WINC1500'.

{% include image.html image=page.image2 %}

Now load the sketch onto your board (by clicking the arrow symbol). Note that the WiFi-Bee must be plugged into your senseBox board (please plug it into XBEE1). Then click on the serial monitor (by clicking on the magnifying glass icon) and it will check if your Wifi-Bee is functional and show you which firmware is installed on it.

{% include image.html image=page.image3 %}

>If you have a firmware <b>19.5.2, or higher >/b> you can cancel here. Your WiFi-Bee is working fine.
>If you have a firmware <b>less than 19.5.2</b> you unfortunately have to update the firmware. You will learn how this works in the next step.

### WiFi-Bee Firmware Update

To update the firmware, follow the path from above: 'File' -> 'Examples' and under 'Examples for senseBox MCU' to 'WINC1500_Updater'.

{% include image.html image=page.image4 %}

Now load the sketch onto your board (by clicking the arrow symbol), on which the WiFi-Bee is plugged in (please plug it into XBEE1).

Then you have to click on 'Tools' and select 'Wifi 101 Firmware Updater'.

{% include image.html image=page.image5 %}

First you can test the connection by clicking on the displayed 'COM Port' and then on 'Test connection'. It should return the following information: `"The programmer is working!

{% include image.html image=page.image6 %}

Almost done, now just click on 'Update Firmware' and the upload starts. After that a success message should appear `"The firmware has been updated!
