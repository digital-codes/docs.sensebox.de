## Supply the senseBox with power
To use the senseBox, it must be supplied with power. There are two ways to supply the senseBox with power:

### 1. USB cable

You can supply the senseBox with power using the USB cable provided. Plug the end of the USB cable into the USB port of the senseBox MCU.  This is located at the top next to the red reset button. The other end of the cable is plugged into the USB port of your computer or a power bank.
